This project has an example of R - code developed for Airfoil related data set. 
The data set information is given below:

Data Set Information:

The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments.

Attribute Information:

This problem has the following inputs:
1. Frequency, in Hertzs.
2. Angle of attack, in degrees.
3. Chord length, in meters.
4. Free-stream velocity, in meters per second.
5. Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.

The only output is:
6. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.

The primary objective of the project is to establish a relation between Scaled sound pressure level as a dependent variable and other variables as independent variables. Several, relationships including, linear, polynomial and quadratic (non-linear) have been tried along with model assumptions validations for illustration.

The .Rmd file contains the r-code and pdf document contains the code as well as the outputs from R execution.
